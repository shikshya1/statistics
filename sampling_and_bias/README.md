# Sampling

The rise of big data in today's world might raise a misconception that we donot need sampling anymore. But it is even more relevant in today's world as we have to deal with data from variety of sources and to minimize bias.It is impractical and unnecessary to measure the whole population. It also helps to save resources.

Sampling frame: List of individuals from which the sample is selected.

Types:

1) Simple random sampling (SRS): A simple random sample of n measurements from a population is a subset of the population is a subset of the population selected in such a way that sample of size n from the population has an equal chance of being selected.

Methods: 

1) Number all the individual in the population with a unique number (like student ID). Put all ID in a hat and draw randomly without looking. Draw 'n' number of ID's and use it as a sample.
2) Generate a list of random numbers for the whole population. Randomly assign the number to the population. Take the first 'n'.

Limitation:
- You need a good list (population that represents your target group properly). Otherwise, there is a risk of under-coverage. Classic example of this case is the Literary Digest poll of 1936 that predicted Alf Landon will win 1936 presidential election over Franklin Roosevelt. They selected a sample of population with high socioeconomic status leading to sample bias.

2) Stratified Sampling

Steps:

- Divide the entire population into distinct subgroups called strata.
- The strata are based on specific characterstics such as age, income, education level and so on.
- All members of a strata share a specific characterstics.
- Draw SRS from ecah each stratum to form a sample.

Oversampling one group might lead to summary statistics being imbalanced. It is hard as you have to first divide the list into strata and then again do sampling through SRS.

3) Systematic sampling:

Steps:

- Arrange all individuals of a population in particular order
- Pick a random individual as a start
- Then take every kth member of the population in the sample. (Note: we cannot perform this when we know there is a specific pattern to the data.)

4) Convenience sampling:

Sample drawn from the part of population that is easiest for the researcher to access. It can be used for low risk cirscumstances.

## Bias:

Sampling errors that are systematic and produced by the sampling process. 

Types:

1) Voluntary and non-response bias: If many people refuse your survey, the people who do it might have a biased opinion. Wrong target group and asking for sensitive information might be few reasons for non-response bias.

2) Truthfulness of response: Respondants might lie on purpose (when asked a question that is too personal or one that is hard to think) or sometimes inadvertently ( when asked about things that happened long time ago)

3) Hidden bias: Different factors induce hidden bias. Some of them are:

- Question wording may induce a certain response. (make sure to include an option if users arenot able to recall a answer)
- Order of question may induce a certain response. 
- Scales of questions mightnot accurately measure responses.

4) Interviewer influence: It is particulary important in case of inperson and phone survey. Avoid using vague terms. All verbal and non-verbal influences matter.

5) Confounding/lurking variable: Variables that is associated with a condition but maynot cause that condition. Example: people with same educational background donot make similar income. Race and gender can be the lurking variable in this case.
